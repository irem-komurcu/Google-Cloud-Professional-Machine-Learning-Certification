## **1. Introduction: How My Journey Began**  

### **Why Did I Decide to Pursue This Certification?**  
As a consultant, I believe that certifications are more than just badges on a CV. They **demonstrate expertise** and help professionals stay up to date with industry advancements.  

Deloitte Partner **Barƒ±≈ü Yenid√ºnya** once made a great analogy:  

> *"Having a certification doesn't necessarily mean you're an expert in the field‚Äîjust like having a driver's license doesn't mean you're a great driver."*  

That being said, earning this certification **validates your knowledge of Google Cloud's ML services**.  

With nearly **six years of experience** in data science, it took me about **2‚Äì3 weeks** to prepare. However, the time required will depend on **your familiarity with Google Cloud and ML concepts**.

## **3. My Exam Experience**  

### **Exam Day Experience**  
- **Online Participation:** The exam is purchased through **Webassessor**. You need a **stable internet connection, a webcam, and a quiet environment**.  
- **No Materials Allowed:** No written materials, pens, or paper are permitted. The proctor verifies these conditions before the exam begins.  
- **No Note-Taking Feature:** Unlike the Google Cloud Digital Leader exam, this exam **did not provide a note-taking area**. All calculations and thought processes had to be done mentally.  

### **My Approach to Answering Questions**  
#### **üîπ Focus on the Scenario, Not the Story**  
The questions are generally long and **scenario-based**. Instead of getting caught up in unnecessary details, I focused on the **key technical aspects**.  

Example:  
- If a question mentions a **large enterprise**, think about **scalability** and **big data** solutions.  

#### **üîπ Match Services with Key Features**  
Many Google Cloud services have similar functionalities, so I focused on **their subtle differences**.  

Example comparisons:  
| Service A | Service B | Key Difference |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **BigQuery** | **Cloud SQL** | Big data analytics vs. transactional data |
| **Dataflow** | **Dataproc** | Streaming data vs. batch processing |
| **Vertex AI** | **AI Platform** | Model training vs. scalability |  

This strategy helped me when I was **stuck between two answers**.
